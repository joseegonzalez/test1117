I had trouble getting information from the internet again. It looks like I was having the same problem as I was last time
but couldn't remember how to do it. I decided to Set up a seperate service class but that did not work. The APP runs but does 
nothing. So then I decided to just use the actual JSON file. I wanted to commit my work first and ran into a few problems
on Git. By the time those were cleared up class was over.
